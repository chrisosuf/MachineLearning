# Animal Image Classification

This is an image preprocessing and recgonition project for 4 classes of images using a convolutional neural network. The images are of 4 different animal types and the preprocessing is explained in the code as well as the model building, training, and testing. There are three convolution operations.

Each folder of animals to test on only containted 200 images (800 total). While the results were not dissapointing, they could have certainly be improved with more data inputs.
